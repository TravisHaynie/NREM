# Book Search Engine

## Description

Welcome to my **Book Search Engine** project, a full-stack web application where users can search for books and save their favorites. The app is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack with Apollo Server to handle GraphQL queries and mutations. This project demonstrates my ability to work with complex data queries, user authentication, and responsive UI design. You can search for books, save them to your account, and view your saved books across sessions.

## Key Features

- **GraphQL API with Apollo Server**: Replaces the traditional RESTful API for better data querying and flexibility.
- **Search and Save Books**: Allows users to search for books and save them to their personal account.
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and logout functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, ensuring it works smoothly on various devices.
- **Saved Book Management**: Users can view and delete saved books in their collection.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Apollo Server**: To manage GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **GraphQL**: For querying and manipulating book data.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data and saved books.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Server-side technologies to handle API requests.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **Vite**: Frontend tooling for faster builds and Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication and user sessions.
